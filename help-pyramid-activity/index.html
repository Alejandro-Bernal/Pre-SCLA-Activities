                    <p> I learned from Roberto that he was inspired to learn computer science in order to create. Roberto was inspired to learn on his own and started learning javascript during his college career, he enjoyed creating websites and applications to help people. Now Roberto enjoys creating 3d printed solutions that both combines programming and hardware.</p>

                        <p> My Approach was to first ask 3 Good Questions: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What Tools do I need to Use to Design a 3d Character?</li>
                            <li>What is a Rig in 3d modeling?</li>
                            <li>How would I write code needed to move a 3D Character?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The duck help me understand that we need a tool like Unity or Unreal Engine in order to rig a 3d model. Rigging is a tool that helps 3D animators create smooth and real animations in characters that are 3D. At the top you can see that I was able to use Unity in order to get a 3d charcter to run. This was done using the concept of rigging and giving the charcter real time movement.
